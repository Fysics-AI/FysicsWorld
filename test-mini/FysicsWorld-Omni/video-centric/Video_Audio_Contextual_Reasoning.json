The scene cuts to two men on a brown leather couch. One has partially gray, short hair, and wears a black t-shirt. The other man has short black hair, a black t-shirt with a green design, and yellow and white sneakers. A bearded man appears in a smaller frame in the bottom right corner. The man with gray hair talks and gestures while the other man listens. The perspective switches to the bearded man who is wearing headphones and a black t-shirt against a swirling purple, teal, and red background.  “CHECK THE DESCRIPTION” and “BOBBY’S PERSPECTIVE” appear in orange and purple text. The scene returns to the two men on the couch; both are now gesturing as they talk. The video cuts back to Bobby, who is talking and gesturing. Two men sit at a table with a laptop between them.  One wears a camouflage tank top and a baseball cap, and the other a black t-shirt.  They appear to be having a conversation. The scene cuts back to the men on the brown couch.  Bobby reappears, looking down. An image of a shirtless man with tattoos appears with text that reads \"LAST TIME TATE DRUNK\". The scene changes back to Bobby, who raises his eyebrows and speaks, looking directly at the camera.  Bobby closes his eyes and lowers his head slightly."
