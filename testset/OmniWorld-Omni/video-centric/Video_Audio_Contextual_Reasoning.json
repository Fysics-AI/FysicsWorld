A crumpled blue glove lies on the table near an amber plastic container with an orange cap.  The man puts on the blue glove. He picks up the small amber container and pours some orange liquid from it into the clear plastic jar with liquid. The liquid in the jar turns purple. He places the amber container back on the table. He picks up the small brown plastic bottle with the white lid, opens it, and pours the dark liquid from the small brown bottle into the glass.  He places the small brown bottle back on the table.  He picks up the clear jar with the purple liquid and pours it into the glass with the brown liquid. He puts the clear jar back on the table.  He removes the blue glove.  He picks up the small white container next to the amber one and pours some white powder from it into the glass with the mixed purple and brown liquids.  He places the small white container back on the table and places the now-empty blue glove on top of it. He picks up the rectangular prism made of clear plastic and uses it to scoop up some of the mixed liquid from the glass and transfer it to the beaker. He then pours the liquid from the glass into the beaker as well. He picks up the glass and drinks the remaining liquid in it. He picks up the small brown plastic bottle again and closes the lid. He puts it back down on the table.  He moves the beaker closer to himself. He picks up the clear glass, which is now empty, and places it upside down on top of the beaker. He then pours the liquid from the beaker into the upside-down glass. He lifts the beaker and places it next to the glass, which is still upside down and now filled with liquid. He walks away from the table."

This changes to a different view of the hall, where two people are walking on the lower level below the floating spheres.  Then there is a shot of 3 people, two in light colored clothes and a third with dark clothing, with the third person pointing towards the top of the frame. The next series of shots shows different views inside a metallic shaft with metallic spheres and green electrical currents flowing by the camera. Another shot shows a dark night time exterior scene, and then a view of the bottom of a vehicle. A woman and two men can be seen running up stairs inside a space station, and then a person with dark clothing opens a round hatch and a person in a tan uniform carries items in an opening. The next shot shows a control room with many lit panels and then a view of an opening filling with red light and smoke. The final two characters, a man and woman in space suits, look towards the glowing opening.  The final shots show a series of burning shapes and then some text including \"FAR AND AWAY\" followed by \"THE MOST PROVOCATIVE AND UNUSUAL ADVENTURE FILM YOU'VE EVER SEEN\". Then \"FORBIDDEN PLANET AN M-G-M PICTURE\" is shown, followed by \"STARRING WALTER PIDGEON, ANNE FRANCIS, LESLIE NIELSEN and THE ROBOT\" followed by a wide angle shot of the landscape and then the text \"TWO YEARS IN THE MAKING IN CINEMASCOPE\"."

The video continues as a person wearing a blue mask, a red and blue beanie, glasses, a dark blue shirt, and patterned grey and black gloves, walks down an aisle in a store. The aisle is lined with shelves containing toys. The person in the video examines many boxes and packages, picking them up, putting them down, and looking at them. The person also looks at their cellphone, examining the screen. The person holds up a package of toys and reaches into an open box of similar packages. The video then changes to a shot of a person with long blonde hair staring forward. Their face is slightly blurred. The shot changes back to the person in the store who continues to examine packages. Some of the packages have \"Halo\" written on them. The person holds a package up, pulls it out of a larger open box, and examines the back of it. The camera continues to show a variety of toy packages."

A brick wall borders part of the property.Next, a hand holds a smartphone displaying a sun path tracking app.  The app shows the sun's trajectory across the sky, overlaid on a view of trees.  Several small white flags are shown staked in a weedy patch of ground near the house.The perspective shifts to various angles around the yard, showing weeds, a tree stump, and gardening tools leaning against the house.  A concrete basin is situated next to the brick wall.A view of the street in front of the house follows, showing parked cars and a wet, muddy road after rain.  A pile of rocks is visible in the foreground.  This scene transitions into a depiction of a small stream or creek flowing through a wooded area.A screenshot of the Calscape website appears, showing information about the Western Sycamore tree.  The website displays images of the tree, a range map, and plant details.  Then, a search for \"Sage\" is entered on the Calscape website, showing various sage species native to California.  The zip code \"91109\" is entered, refining the search results.  The Hummingbird Sage (Salvia spathacea) is selected, and its details are displayed.The video returns to the house, showing rain falling on the yard through a window.  Raindrops cover the glass.  The rain is also viewed from a different window, showing a red barrel and white flags in the yard.  A puddle forms in the dry grass next to the house.Hand-drawn plans for the yard are then shown.  The plans depict the layout of plants, a patio, pathways, and other features.  Different zones are marked with colored highlighters.  A second plan focuses on the stormwater retention system, including rain barrels, bioswales, and catch basins.The BeWaterWise.com website appears next, with sections on rebates, classes, gardens, and more.  The \"Turf Replacement Program\" page is shown, highlighting the program's requirements and application process.  The SoCal WaterSmart rebate portal website is then displayed, showing the turf replacement application page.Finally, the video concludes with the hand-drawn stormwater retention plan overlaid onto a view of rocks and soil in the yard, which transitions to a close-up of a dry creek bed lined with rocks and mulch, newly planted with native plants.  Several potted plants are shown on the ground, and two red rain barrels collect water from a downspout."

In order to be legally detained, there has to be reasonable suspicion that you have committed or are about to commit a crime.\" Then another text box appears, stating: \"Not having ID at a federal building is not an actual criminal act (even if it was a requirement to enter that building). They also say in the video that he had not been trespassed from the property, which is actually public property. In addition, they never told him he had to leave. In fact, they illegally prevented him from doing so.\" Finally, another text box appears, stating: \"Therefore, (as they themselves admitted several times) the man in this video was not at any time being investigated for having committed a crime. That means he was not legally detained nor was he obligated to identify himself to them (regardless of whether they are \"the local police\").\" The video then transitions to a scene outside a building. A police officer wearing a tan uniform with dark pants is seen at the corner of a building. He then turns to his right and another police officer walks up. The first officer points and moves to his right while the second walks into the scene. A man wearing a suit with a light colored tie walks by. The video then shows the first officer walking along a paved area where three men are sitting on a low wall. The video then switches to a front facing perspective of one of the men in a black leather jacket and blue jeans. Another man wearing a plaid shirt is also visible. As the man in the black jacket is speaking, another man appears from behind the camera, pointing his finger and placing it near the lens. The video continues with the man in the black jacket speaking. A police officer then appears on screen and moves to the other side of the scene, turning to face the seated men. He motions with his hand as if counting. The camera perspective then switches again to another officer moving into the scene as the original camera perspective of the men is briefly visible before the new officer blocks it from view. The camera angle then shows one of the seated men being pulled and grabbed by the arms by the officers, and placed into the back of a police vehicle. The video continues to show the police officers at the scene. The video switches to an inside view of the police vehicle as the seated man is placed into it. One of the police officers puts his hands on the seated man's shoulder and attempts to strap him in. The video continues showing the man now inside the vehicle as the police officer tightens the man's seat belt. The police officer then closes the vehicle's door and the video ends."

Several more clumps of onions are placed into the skillet, which gradually becomes more full. The onion balls gradually become more golden-brown as they fry.The scene again shifts to the white bowl where, this time, a person in white chef’s attire is mixing and forming the onion mixture into balls using both hands.The camera returns to the skillet, where several more onion balls are being fried, becoming increasingly brown. More onion balls are dropped into the skillet by the chef. Finally, some of the cooked onion balls are removed from the skillet using a slotted, metal spatula and placed into a metal colander to drain. Excess oil drips back into the skillet.  The frying process continues. More onion balls are formed and dropped into the hot oil, while others continue to cook to a golden-brown color."
